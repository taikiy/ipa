/// Step "a" comprises two actions "x" and "y", but "b" and "c" are atomic actions.
/// Step "a" would be executed with a context identifier of "protocol/a", which it
///  would `narrow()` into "protocol/a/x" and "protocol/a/y" to produce a final set
/// of identifiers: ".../a/x", ".../a/y", ".../b", and ".../c".
